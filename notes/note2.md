# Note 2: Git Branching & Collaboration

## Branching
- Branches let you work on new features without affecting main code.

Create a branch:
  git branch feature-1
  git checkout feature-1

Or in one step:

git checkout -b feature-1

Merging
Switch to main branch:
git checkout main


Merge changes from feature branch:
git merge feature-1


Collaboration
Pull the latest changes:
git pull origin main


Push your branch:

git push origin feature-1
